	    <Section><Heading>Introduction</Heading>
	   The notion of the table of marks of a finite group <M>G</M> was introduced by William Burnside in the second edition of his famous book, Theory of 
Groups of Finite Order, <Cite Key="Bur55"/>, and it is often referred to as the Burnside matrix of <M>G</M>. The table of marks of <M>G</M> is a square matrix whose rows and 
columns are indexed by the conjugacy classes of subgroups of <M>G</M> and where for any two conjugacy classes of subgroups <M>H</M> and <M>K</M>, the 
<M>(H, K)</M>-entry is the number of fixed points of <M>K</M> in the transitive action of <M>G</M> on the cosets of <M>H</M> in <M>G</M>. In this way the table of marks of 
<M>G</M> characterizes the set of all permutation representations of <M>G</M> up to equivalence. At the same time the table of marks of <M>G</M> describes the 
partially order set of all conjugacy classes of subgroups of <M>G</M> since from the number of fixed points the number of conjugates of <M>K</M> contained in 
<M>H</M> can be derived.

<Section><Heading>Computing Tables of Marks</Heading>
Traditionally the computation of the table of marks of a finite group <M>G</M> requires complete knowledge of the entire subgroup lattice of <M>G</M>. 
The marks are then derived by counting inclusions between conjugacy classes of subgroup. This works fine when the order of <M>G</M> is small but is 
impractical when the order of <M>G</M> is large. Pfeiffer <Cite Key="Pfe97"/> has developed a method for computing the table of marks of <M>G</M> from the 
tables of marks of the maximal subgroups of <M>G</M>. This method has been successfully 
used to compute the tables of marks of a variety of groups including, <M>M_{24}, Mcl, S_{12}</M> and <M>A_{13}</M>. However since this 
approach relies on the knowledge of the tables of marks of all maximal subgroups of <M>G</M>, the range of simple and almost simple groups to which it can be applied 
has almost been exhausted.

With this in mnd the authors have developed a collection of algorithms to compute the table of marks of a cyclic extension <M>G.p</M> from the table of marks of <M>G</M>. 
Many groups whose tables of marks have not been computed fall into this category. The functions contained in this package are based on the algorithms described in 
<Cite Key="Nau2011"/>.
